## Generation of time-space correlated isotropic turbulence

The routine generate pseudo isotropic turbulence. 
the main idea of algorithm is compiled from two articles:
- [1] Scalable Tools for Generating Synthetic Isotropic Turbulence with Arbitrary Spectra
- [2] Fully descripted
The article considers simple model of turbulence generation.
